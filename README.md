# RockPaperScissors
Implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.


Psuedocode
1. Begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.
2. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round
2a. Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
3. Write another function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
